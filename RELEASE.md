# Tuwunel 1.4.5

October 24, 2025

All deployments serving ElementX, Element Pro, SchildiChat Next, or any client using sliding-sync should upgrade to this patch for an improved experience.

### Bug Fixes

- Progress made for sliding-sync in 1.4.3 was effectively reverted by 1.4.4. This release puts sliding-sync back on track with further progress exceeding 1.4.3. This release is now shipping without any known issues. Please report all issues. **IMPORTANT:** Issues from prior releases (such as stuck or incorrect unread counts) benefit from clearing the app's cache to immediately resolve. Go to settings, tap the version number 7 times, then enter the menu to select `clear cache`.
