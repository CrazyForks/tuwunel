//! Container animation sniffing
//!
//! A picture names its own format in its first bytes and carries its frame
//! sequence, if it has one, at a place each format fixes. Reading those is what
//! lets a request for a still be honored against a file whose declared content
//! type says otherwise, or says nothing useful, as `image/png` does for an
//! APNG.
//!
//! A walk answers one of three states, because the two questions asked of it
//! take opposite defaults. Whether a picture may be served fails closed, so an
//! unreadable one is withheld and a wrong answer costs a needless re-encode
//! rather than a violation; what a picture is names nothing the walk did not
//! settle, since a guess there would be written down as fact.
