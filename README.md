### Status

Tuwunel is a successor to conduwuit. We are currently in the process of transitioning.
The software is just as great as before. Please bear with us.

### Goals

**Maximum Performance.** Tuwunel relentlessly pursues optimization, embracing hardware
acceleration with the highest throughput and lowest latency for messages.

**Unlimited Features.** Tuwunel is working toward a fully modular design to leverage
the widest number of contributor features. Our goal is to never have to say no to your ideas.

Yes.

#### Can I migrate or switch from Conduit?
